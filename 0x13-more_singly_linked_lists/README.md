## Welcome Aboard the Singly Linked Lists Express! 🚂

Hello there, fellow adventurer! Welcome to the whimsical world of singly linked lists, where data structure meets enchantment. I am kweenDev, your conductor on this thrilling journey through the realm of C programming.

## 🌌 An Extraordinary Voyage

Prepare yourself for an extraordinary voyage as we embark on this magical train of singly linked lists. Each carriage (node) is connected to the next, creating a mesmerizing chain of data that will leave you spellbound.

## 📚 Project Overview

Here's a sneak peek at the tasks that await you on this adventure:

- **`lists.h`:** The conductor's guidebook with all the function prototypes you'll need.
- **`0-print_listint.c`:** Function to announce all the passengers on the list. Every passenger has a destination (data), and they're eager to reveal it!
- **`1-listint_len.c`:** Function to count the number of happy travelers on the list. A conductor's duty is to keep track of the passengers.
- **`2-add_nodeint.c`:** Function to welcome a new passenger to the front of the line. Joining the train has never been easier!
- **`3-add_nodeint_end.c`:** Function to let a passenger join at the end of the journey. Latecomers are always welcome!
- **`4-free_listint.c`:** Function to bid farewell to the travelers at their destination. When the journey ends, we release the passengers with gratitude.
- **`5-free_listint2.c`:** Function to clear the whole train station and set the departure platform to NULL. Sometimes, we need a fresh start!
- **`6-pop_listint.c`:** Function to kick out the first traveler and hand them a ticket home. Some passengers might decide to leave mid-journey.
- **`7-get_nodeint.c`:** Function to show a traveler's destination on the list. We reveal the secrets of each passenger's desired location.
- **`8-sum_listint.c`:** Function to calculate the total number of miles traveled by all the passengers. Every journey has a collective distance.
- **`9-insert_nodeint.c`:** Function to allow a latecomer to squeeze in at a particular spot. Sometimes, a passenger wants a reserved seat!
- **`10-delete_nodeint.c`:** Function to evict a passenger at a specific location. Occasionally, we need to remove a traveler from the list.

## 🚀 Advanced Adventures

For the bravest of engineers, we have some extra challenges! Take a leap into the unknown and tackle the advanced tasks involving reversing the list, dealing with loops, and more! These tasks will put your skills to the test and reward you with a sense of accomplishment like no other.
