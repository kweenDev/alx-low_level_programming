## Introduction

Are you ready to don the coder's cape and wield the power of bits? Bit manipulation isn't just about flipping switches; it's about bending reality to your coding whims. Here, you'll learn to perform digital acrobatics that'll leave 0s and 1s spellbound!

## Getting Started

Fear not, brave coders, for your quest begins with a simple understanding of bits and their binary dance. We'll equip you with the knowledge of AND, OR, XOR, and more. Whether you're a bit-sorcerer or a bit-apprentice, there's something here for everyone.

## Magical Bit Spells

In this enchanted realm, you'll master the art of shifting bits left and right, conjuring mystical masks with bitwise ANDs, and binding numbers with OR incantations. Brace yourself for a code duel with logical operators that'll have you shouting "Eureka!" in no time.

## Bit Manipulation Tasks

#### Task 0: Binary to Unsigned Int Conversion

File: 0-binary_to_uint.c

- Description: This program defines a function `binary_to_uint` that converts a binary string to an unsigned int. It handles error cases such as invalid characters and NULL input.

#### Task 1: Print Binary Representation

File: 1-print_binary.c

- Description: This program defines a function `print_binary` that prints the binary representation of an unsigned long int. It uses recursion to extract and print each bit in reverse order.

#### Task 2: Get Bit Value

File: 2-get_bit.c

- Description: This program defines a function `get_bit` that retrieves the value of a specific bit at an index in an unsigned long int. It includes index validation to ensure the index is within bounds.

#### Task 3: Set Bit Value to 1

File: 3-set_bit.c

- Description: This program defines a function `set_bit` that sets a specific bit at an index in an unsigned long int to 1. The function performs index validation and updates the number accordingly.

#### Task 4: Set Bit Value to 0

File: 4-clear_bit.c

- Description: This program defines a function `clear_bit` that sets a specific bit at an index in an unsigned long int to 0. The function includes index validation and updates the number using bitwise operations.

#### Task 5: Count Different Bits

File: 5-flip_bits.c

- Description: This program defines a function `flip_bits` that counts the number of different bits between two unsigned long ints. The function calculates the XOR of the two numbers and counts the set bits in the result.

#### Task 6: Check Endianness

File: 100-get_endianness.c

- Description: This program defines a function `get_endianness` that determines the endianness of the system using memory manipulation. The function checks the least significant byte to identify the system's endianness.

#### Task 7: Crackme3

File: 101-password

- Description: This file takes an argument that is meant to be the password and then provides an output based on whether the provided password is correct.

#### Usage

Each task is implemented in a separate C file. You can compile the programs individually and run them to see their functionality in action.
