# ALX Low Level Programming - Hello, World

This repository contains a collection of scripts and programs for the ALX Low Level Programming course's "Hello, World" section. The tasks involve working with C files, preprocessors, compilers, assemblers, and executing C programs.

## Mandatory Tasks

1. Preprocessor: [0-preprocessor](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor)

   - This script runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.

2. Compiler: [1-compiler](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler)

   - This script compiles a C file but does not link.

3. Assembler: [2-assembler](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler)

   - This script generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file.

4. Name: [3-name](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x00-hello_world/3-name)

   - This script compiles a C file and creates an executable named "cisfun".

5. Hello, puts: [4-puts.c](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c)

   - This C program prints "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" using the `puts` function.

6. Hello, printf: [5-printf.c](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c)

   - This C program prints "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art" using the `printf` function.

7. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation: [6-size.c](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c)

   - This C program prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

## Advanced Tasks

8. Intel: [100-intel](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x00-hello_world/100-intel)

   - This script generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and saves it in an output file.

9. UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity: [101-quote.c](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x00-hello_world/101-quote.c)

   - This C program prints a quote by Dora Korpar to the standard error.
