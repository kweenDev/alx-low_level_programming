## Hash Tables and Linked Lists in C

## Overview
Hash tables are data structures that provide efficient data retrieval. They work by mapping keys to indexes in an array, allowing for constant time average complexity for search, insert, and delete operations. This project explores the implementation of hash tables and basic linked list operations in the C programming language.

## Tasks
### Task 0: Understanding Hash Tables
**Description:**
- Gain a foundational understanding of hash tables and their importance in computer science. Hash tables offer quick data retrieval by utilizing a hash function to map keys to specific indexes in an array.

### Task 1: Implementing a Simple Hash Function
**Description:**
- Create a basic hash function that takes a string key and returns an index. This task lays the groundwork for the hash table's key-index mapping.

### Task 2: Creating a Hash Table Structure
**Description:**
- Define the structure for a hash table, outlining how key-value pairs will be stored. This includes creating an array to hold linked lists for handling collisions.

### Task 3: Initializing a Hash Table
**Description:**
- Write a function to initialize a hash table, allocating memory for the array and initializing each element to NULL. Proper initialization sets the stage for subsequent operations.

### Task 4: Hashing Keys and Inserting into the Table
**Description:**
- Implement the logic to hash keys and insert key-value pairs into the hash table. Handle collisions by appending nodes to linked lists at the corresponding array index.

### Task 5: Retrieving a Value from the Hash Table
**Description:**
- Create a function to retrieve the value associated with a given key from the hash table. This involves hashing the key and traversing the linked list at the resulting index.

### Task 6: Updating a Value in the Hash Table
**Description:**
- Write a function to update the value associated with a key in the hash table. This task ensures the hash table remains dynamic and adaptable to changing data.

### Task 7: Understanding the Basics of Linked Lists
**Description:**
- Delve into the fundamentals of linked lists, a crucial data structure often used in conjunction with hash tables. Understand how nodes in a linked list are connected, paving the way for efficient data manipulation.
