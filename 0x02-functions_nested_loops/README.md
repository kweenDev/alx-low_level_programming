# ALX Low Level Programming - 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

This repository contains a collection of scripts and programs for the ALX Low Level Programming "Functions, nested loops" section. The tasks involve working with nested while loops and how to use them, C-functions, function prototypes and how to use them, C-header files, and how to use them with `#include` as well as `gcc` flags.

## Mandatory Tasks

0. `_putchar`: [0-putchar.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/0-putchar.c)

   - This program will print `_putchar` followed by a new line.

1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game: [1-alphabet.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/1-alphabet.c)

   - This program will have a function that will print the alphabet in lowercase followed by a new line.

2. 10 x alphabet: [2-print_alphabet_x10.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops//2-print_alphabet_x10.c)

   - This program prints the alphabet in lowercase 10 times, followed by a new line.

3. islower: [3-islower.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/3-islower.c)

   - This script writes a function that checks for lowercase characters.

4. isalpha: [4-isalpha.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/4-isalpha.c)

   - This C program writes a function that checks for alphabetic characters.

5. Sign: [5-sign.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/5-sign.c)

   - This C program writes a function that prints the sign of a number.

6. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you: [6-abs.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/6-abs.c)

   - This C program writes a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

7. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important: [7-print_last_digit.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/7-print_last_digit.c)

   - This program writes a function that prints the last digit of a number and returns the value of the last digit.

8. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life: [8-24_hours.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/8-24_hours.c)

   - This program writes a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from `00:00` to `23:59`.

9. Learn your times table: [9-times_table.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/9-times_table.c)

   - This program writes a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

10. a + b: [10-add.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/10-add.c)

   - This program writes a function that adds two integers and returns the sum.

11. 98 Battery Street, the OG: [11-print_to_98.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/11-print_to_98.c)

   - This program writes a function that prints all natural numbers from `n` to `98`, followed by a new line.

## Advanced Tasks

12. The World looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself: [100-times_table.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/100-times_table.c)

   - This program writes a function that prints the `n` times table starting with `0`.


13. Nature made the natural numbers; All else is the work of women: [101-natural.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/101-natural.c)

   - This program computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of `3` or `5` below `1024` (excluded), followed by a new line.

14. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A: [102-fibonacci.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/102-fibonacci.c)

   - This program prints the first `50 Fibonacci numbers`, starting with `1` and `2`, followed by a new line.

15. Even Liber Abbaci: [103-fibonacci.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/103-fibonacci.)

   - This program finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms, followed by a new line.

16. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first `100 Fibonacci numbers`. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A+: [104-fibonacci.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/104-fibonacci.c)

   - This program finds and prints the first `98 Fibonacci numbers`, starting with `1` and `2`, followed by a new line.
