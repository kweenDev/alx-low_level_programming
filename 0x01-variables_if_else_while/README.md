# ALX Low Level Programming - 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

This repository contains a collection of scripts and programs for the ALX Low Level Programming "Variables, if, else, while" section. The tasks involve working with C files, keywords and identifiers, integers, if statements, if...else statements, relational operators, logical operators, while loops, arithmetic operators, and how to declare variables of different types of data.

## Mandatory Tasks

0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing: [0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c)

   - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.

1. The last digit: [1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c)

   - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.

2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game: [2-print_alphabet.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c)

   - This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function twice max.

3. alphABET: [3-print_alphabets.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c)

   - This script prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line only using the `putchar` function three times max.

4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off: [4-print_alphabt.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c)

   - This C program prints the alphabet in lowercase except `q` and `e`, followed by a new line using only the `putchar` function up to a max two times.

5. Numbers: [5-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c)

   - This C program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line inside the `main` function.

6. Numberz: [6-print_numberz.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c)

   - This C program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line. Only the `putchar` function is allowed to be used for a maximum of two times. `char` is not allowed.

7. Smile in the mirror: [7-print_tebahpla.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c)

   - This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line, only using the `putchar` function for a maximum of two times.

8. Hexadecimal: [8-print_base16.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c)

   - This program prints all numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line and only using the `putchar` function for a maximum of two times.

9. Patience. persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success: [9-print_comb.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c)

   - This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers in ascending order, which will be separated by a `,`, followed by a space and only using the `putchar` function for a maximum of four times.

## Advanced Tasks

10. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need: [100-int_comb3.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/100-print_comb3.c)

   - This program prints all possible different combinations of two digits in ascending order, which will be separated by `,`, followed by a space and only using the `putchar` function for a maximum of five times. `char` function is not allowed.

11. The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do...: [101-print_comb4.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/101-print_comb4.c)

   - This program prints all possible different combinations of three digits in ascending order, which will be separated by `,`, followed by a space and only using the `putchar` function for a maximum of six times. Use of `char` function is not allowed.

12. Software is eating the World: [102-print_comb5.c](https://github.com/kweenDev/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/102-print_comb5.c)

   - This program prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers, which range from `0` to `99` in ascending order, with the two numbers separated by a space and only using the `putchar` function for a maximum of eight times. Use of `char` function is forbidden.
