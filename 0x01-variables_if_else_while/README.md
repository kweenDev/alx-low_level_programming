# ALX Low Level Programming - 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

This repository contains a collection of scripts and programs for the ALX Low Level Programming "Variables, if, else, while" section. The tasks involve working with C files, keywords and identifiers, integers, if statements, if...else statements, relational operators, logical operators, while loops, arithmetic operators, and how to declare variables of different types of data.

## Mandatory Tasks

0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing: 0-positive_or_negative.c

   - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.

1. The last digit: 1-last_digit.c

   - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.

2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game: 2-print_alphabet.c

   - This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

3. Name: 3-name

   - This script compiles a C file and creates an executable named "cisfun".

4. Hello, puts: 4-puts.c

   - This C program prints "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" using the `puts` function.

5. Hello, printf: 5-printf.c

   - This C program prints "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art" using the `printf` function.

6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation: 6-size.c

   - This C program prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

## Advanced Tasks

7. Intel: 100-intel

   - This script generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and saves it in an output file.

8. UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity: 101-

   - This C program prints a quote by Dora Korpar to the standard error.
